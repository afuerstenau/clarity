In today's organizations it's problematic to have the right level of clarity about the infrastructure and services.

One common approach to solve this is to document the architecture (and everything else) in a more or less static and detailed manner but the result is often a static out of date result.

Another common approach is to make everybody in the department (or the whole organization) using the same architecture/infrastructure but the result here is that it's hard to upgrade, inappropriate components are being used and/or people try to sneak in more appropriate components.

In every case the lack of clarity to make the right decisions seems to be a big problem. It's at least one for me.

Clarity tries to solve that problem by providing (as automated as possible) static (components and relations) and dynamic (monitoring) information.
